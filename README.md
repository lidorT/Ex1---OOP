#### This is an object oriented programmin project which his main idea is based on functions. 

#### This project was wrriten by Zohar Meir & Lidor Tal during our Object Oriented Programming course at Ariel University with the guidance of Professor Boaz Ben Moshe all rights reserved to us ©.

#### This project contains an stdDraw interface which was created by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne ©.

#### On this project you will find three kinds of objects : Monom, Polynom, and Complex Function all of them implements function interface.

**[Monom -](https://github.com/lidorT/Ex1---OOP/wiki/Monom)** Monom represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where a is a real number and b is an integer (summed a none negative). 

**[Polynom -](https://github.com/lidorT/Ex1---OOP/wiki/Polynom)** Polynom represents a Polynom at the form of: " 5x^5+3x^4+2x+6 " for example.

**[Complex Function-](https://github.com/lidorT/Ex1---OOP/wiki/Complex-Function)** represents a ComplexFunction which is a combination of number of Polynoms at the form of : " Operator(Polynom,Polynom) ".

* Each of the above objects suppourts number of functions including mathematical caculations such as Plus, Divide, Substract , Multiply and more. 

* Each of the above objects can be initialized from a string and aswell from inserting each object each time.

for example a string initialize of a Monom: "6.5x^2" 

for example a string initialize of a Polynom: "65.25x^4 - 33.5x^3 + 25.2x^2 - 3.3x +5.5 "

for example a string initialize of a Complex Function: " div(plus(-1.0x^4 +2.4x^2 +3.1,+0.1x^5 -1.3x +5.0),-1.0x^4 +2.4x^2 +3.1) "

* This project suppourts the option to calculate the Area of a Polynom.

* This project suppourts the option to calculate the roots of a given Polynom.

* Using this project will grant you the ability to even print a Complex Function to a plot.
