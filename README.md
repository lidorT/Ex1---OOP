### This is an object oriented programmin project which his main idea is based on functions. 
### On this project you will find three kinds of objects : Monom, Polynom, and Complex Function all of them implements function interface.
**Monom -** Monom represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where a is a real number and b is an integer (summed a none negative). 
**Polynom -** Polynom represents a Polynom at the form of: " 5x^5+3x^4+2x+6 " for example.
**Complex Function-** represents a ComplexFunction which is a combination of number of Polynoms at the form of : " Operator(Polynom,Polynom) ".

Each of the above objects suppourts number of functions including mathematical caculations such as Plus, Divide, Substract , Multiply and more. 

Each of the above objects can be initialized from a string and aswell from inserting each object each time.

Using this project will grant you the ability to even print a Complex Function to a plot.
